# Revision history for grailsort

## 1.0.0.2

* Optimized Naive.grailBlockSwap to not swap elements one by one

## 1.0.0.1 -- 2024-01-10

* Simplified testing function for ease of adding more algorithms as inputs.

## 1.0.0.0 -- 2023-12-06

* All the functions have been implemented and the code is working as intended.

## 0.2.1.0 --2023-12-04

* The vector implementation in-place is finally working; oop methods to be written

## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-11-19

* Code no longer has major problems, requires major reordering to ensure the correct order of execution

## 0.1.1.1 -- 2023-11-14

* Minor cleanup in the Naive code, rewritten the main file, still trying to make it work as it should

## 0.1.1.0 -- 2023-09-18

* Minor tweaks in GrailSort.Naive.grailRotate and GrailSort.Naive.grailBlockSwap to reduce memory clutter

## 0.1.0.11 -- 2023-08-19

* Including Data.STRef to simplify code conversion

## 0.1.0.10 -- 2023-08-09

* Starting properer rewriting of the version using MVectors, including desugaring where it can work

## 0.1.0.9 -- 2023-07-14

* Minor fixes

## 0.1.0.8 -- 2023-07-11

* The fully functional implementation is complete and working.

## 0.1.0.7 -- 2023-06-19

* Finished the in-place portion of fully functional implementation, several out-of-place method remaining.

## 0.1.0.6 -- 2023-03-23

* Started creating a naive implementation (no vectors, only lists) in hopes of learning the math behind how Haskell works, moved partially done thing to a single project.

## 0.1.0.5 --2022-12-14

* Solved part of problem with sorting multiple duplicates on list, known issue is doing so wholly.

## 0.1.0.4 --2022-09-01

* Further development, bug where input with multiple duplicate values caused a 'Division by zero' exception got fixed.

## 0.1.0.3 -- 2022-08-16

* Development goes forward, bug with input having length 25 got fixed.

## 0.1.0.2 -- 2022-07-27

## 0.1.0.0 -- 2022-07-23

* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world. (not really released, but let's go with it)
